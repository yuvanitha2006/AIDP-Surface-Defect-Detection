# AIDP-Surface-Defect-Detection
AI-based intelligent surface defect detection using machine learning and anomaly analysis with dashboard visualization.

This project presents an AI-based approach for automated surface defect
detection in industrial materials using machine learning and anomaly
detection techniques.

The system preprocesses surface images, extracts meaningful features,
detects defects, and visualizes results through an interactive dashboard.
